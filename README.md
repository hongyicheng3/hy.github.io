## Projects
These are some projects that highlight my ability to apply Python across different domains, demonstrating problem-solving skills, coding proficiency, and a passion for working with this programming language.

### Exoplanet detection:

This project involved developing an algorithm to detect exoplanets using data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Sky Survey (TESS). I employed a Box-Least-Squares algorithm on 20000 measurements using the **NumPy**, **SciPy** and **MatPlotLib** Python libraries in order to identify potential exoplanet candidates based on observed stellar data. This project sharpened my skills in data analysis, data visualisation, and algorithm development.

### Machine learning model (RandomForest):

This project focuses on implementing a RandomForest to predict the likelihood of a customer buying a ticket based on features from 50000 bookings. Using Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **SciKit Learn** and **MatPlotLib**, I was able to prepare a dataset from a job simulation in Forage to implement a machine learning model. Then, I evaluated the model's performance, and prepared some visualisations on the performance. This project helped me enhance my skills in machine learning, data visualisation, and data manipulation.

### Web scraping and analysis:

In this project, I extracted 1000 reviews from a website to perform a sentiment analysis and some word clouds with the help of some Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **NLTK**, **BeautifulSoup**, **Requests** and **MatPlotLib**. It helped me develop my skills in web scraping, data manipulation, data analysis and data visualisation.
