This project involved developing an algorithm to detect exoplanets using data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Sky Survey (TESS). I employed a Box-Least-Squares algorithm with the **NumPy**, **SciPy** and **MatPlotLib** Python libraries in order to identify potential exoplanet candidates based on observed stellar data. This project sharpened my skills in data analysis, data visualisation, and algorithm development.

This project focuses on implementing a RandomForest to predict the likelihood of a customer buying a ticket based on some features. Using Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **SciKit** and **MatPlotLib**, I was able to prepare a dataset from a job simulation in Forage to implement a machine learning model. Then, I evaluated the model's performance, and then output some visualisations on the performance. This project help me enhance my skills in machine learning, data visualisation, and data manipulation.

In this project, I extracted data from a website to perform a sentiment analysis and some word clouds with the help of some Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **NLTK**, **BeautifulSoup**, **Requests** and **MatPlotLib**. It helped me develop my skills in web scraping, data manipulation, data analysis and data visualisation.
